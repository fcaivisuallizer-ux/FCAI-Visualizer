# AlgoViz Migration Status Report

## ✅ Work Completed (Phases 1, 2, and 3)

### 1. Project Infrastructure
- **React/Vite Setup**: Initialized the `algoviz-react` project with all necessary dependencies.
- **Modern Layout**: Implemented a responsive sidebar-based layout using React Router and Lucide icons.
- **Theme System**: Integrated Dark/Light mode support.
- **Cross-Cutting Features**:
  - **Persistence**: Added `useLang` hook to save preferred code language. Updated Theme context for `localStorage` persistence.
  - **Custom Input**: Updated `ControlPanel` to allow comma-separated custom array inputs.
  - **Sound Architecture**: Added `audioEngine.js` stub using Web Audio API (ready to be wired).
  - **Complexity Panel**: Reusable component rendering Big O metrics across pages.

### 2. Algorithm Migration
- **Trees Module**: Ported `avlTree.js` and `treeVisualizer.js`. Integrated with React in `Trees.jsx`.
- **Sorting Module**:
  - Extracted 8 sorting generators into `sortingGenerators.js`.
  - Built `Sorting.jsx` with full state management and URL syncing.
  - Reconstructed `sortingVisualizer.js` with support for Bars, Cells, Quick Partition, and Merge Tree views.
- **Searching Module**:
  - Migrated Linear, Binary, and Jump search generators (`searchingGenerators.js`).
  - Implemented Canvas-based `searchingVisualizer.js` with pointer annotations.
  - Built `Searching.jsx` page with target-value inputs.

### 3. Responsive Design
- Added media queries for mobile-friendly layouts.
- Implemented a collapsible mobile sidebar with a backdrop overlay.
- Ensured visualizer canvases resize properly within their containers.

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES FOR THE NEXT DEVELOPER 🚨

**1. Sorting Algorithms Are Broken (Canvas Container Issue)**
- **The Bug:** If you open `/sorting/bubble`, the canvas does not draw anything and throws a JavaScript error in the console.
- **The Cause:** In `sortingVisualizer.js` (lines 326, 614, and potentially others), the visualizer attempts to get the dimensions of the canvas wrapper using `document.getElementById('viz-panel')`. However, during the layout refactor in `Sorting.jsx`, the wrapper was changed to a generic `div` with `className="sorting-canvas-wrapper"`. Because `viz-panel` no longer exists, `document.getElementById('viz-panel')` returns `null`, causing `panel.clientWidth` to throw a `TypeError`.
- **The Fix:** Replace `document.getElementById('viz-panel')` with `canvas.parentElement` in `sortingVisualizer.js` (like it was done correctly in `searchingVisualizer.js`).

**2. Missing `drawRadixStep` Function**
- **The Bug:** Radix Sort will fail to render.
- **The Cause:** In `sortingVisualizer.js` (line 342), there is a block of code checking for `typeof drawRadixStep === 'function'`, but `drawRadixStep` is actually not defined anywhere in the file. The original legacy code for Radix buckets needs to be ported into `sortingVisualizer.js`.

## 🚀 What's Left (Remaining Phases)

### Phase 4: Data Structures
- Migrate visualizers for Arrays, Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists.
- These require specific HUD controls (Push/Pop/Enqueue/Dequeue).

### Phase 5: Graphs
- Port BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's logic.
- Implement the Graph drawing and weight management logic.
- Highlight the "Shortest Path Tree" as it builds.

### Phase 6: Practice Mode
- Port the quiz/practice logic from the legacy codebase into a React-friendly structure.

### Phase 7: Polish & Final Verification
- Final bug fixes, transition animations, and performance optimization.
- Wire up the `AudioEngine` to animation callbacks.
